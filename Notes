Notes for TA meeting:
For review scores, I will use median scores.

For bedrooms, I will use 0 (the single observation is a studio, per the description)

For bathrooms, I'm tempted to use 1 for the single observation. It is an entire home/house that accommodates 4.

Response Rate should be 100 -- it's the median, and over 75% of obs are 100.

Response time ???

City/Zip?

Overview/Rules?? Ignore...




unique() with apply

impute an unknown category for response rates

use plot with apply family!
